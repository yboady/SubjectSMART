### Abstract

## Description 

## Project Goal
This project aims to develop an application for Coexya, with the following objectives:

- **Employee Engagement Through RSE Challenges:** Create an engaging platform where employees can participate in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) challenges and games outside of their working hours.

- **Functional and Deployable Solution:** Ensure the application is fully functional and ready for deployment within Coexya's infrastructure, focusing on reliability and scalability.

- **User-Friendly Design:** Design the application with a strong emphasis on ergonomics, making it easy and pleasant for employees to use regularly.

- **Advanced Gamification Features:** Incorporate advanced gamification elements to enhance user engagement and motivation by transforming CSR activities into a rewarding and fun experience.

- **Ongoing Development and Evolution:** Plan for the application's continuous improvement by adding new features and functionalities over time, based on user feedback and evolving company needs.

- **Integration of AI for Challenge Generation:** Explore the potential integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate new and unique CSR challenges, personalizing the experience for each user and encouraging ongoing participation.

- **Community Building:** Foster a sense of community among employees by encouraging collaboration and competition through leaderboards, team challenges, and social sharing capabilities.

- **Impact Tracking and Reporting:** Include features for tracking and reporting the collective impact of the CSR activities completed by employees, providing valuable insights into the company's social and environmental contributions.

These objectives outline our plan for creating a dynamic and impactful application that not only **engages Coexya's employees in meaningful CSR activities but also aligns with the company's values and commitment to social responsibility.**
